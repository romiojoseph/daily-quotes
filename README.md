This project is inspired by a childhood memory of a box full of cards, where I'd pick one each day and find a message that often felt just right. Sometimes, a quote speaks to something we’re going through quietly, even when it’s hard to put into words. Other times, it’s just a gentle reminder for the day. All quotes are sourced from LLMs. If you find any mistakes or incorrect attribution, [please send a message here](https://bsky.app/profile/romio.substack.com).
